Hi Gitez, I have created this repository to automate the manual validation tasks related to checking PDF data against an Excel sheet. 
The process involves validating specific fields from the provided PDF files and comparing them with corresponding entries in the Excel sheet.
Download this file and directly open it in VS-code.
Install Python interperters to run the code.
